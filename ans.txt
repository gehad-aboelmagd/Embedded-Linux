1. Three linux distributions
	Ubuntu, Red Hat, Debian

2. man command is used for navigating the documentaion of specific command; it provides detailed descriptions more than usual help command; it is based on less, so we can navigate both up and down :)

3. rm is used to delete a regular file or remove a whole directory using the recursive flag. rmdir is used to delete an empty directory; we cann't use it to delete a non-empty folder.

4. 1)
	cd ~
	mkdir -p dir1/dir11
	mkdir dir1/dir12
	touch dir1/dir11/file1

  2)
	mkdir docs
	touch docs/mycv

  3)
	mkdir documents
	touch documents/OldFiles	 
	
  a)
	rmdir dir1/dir11
	rmdir: failed to remove 'dir1/dir11': Directory not empty
	// Notice: we can't remove a non-empty file using mkdir
	rm -r dir1/dir11

  b) if we consider OldFiles as a directory, not a file, we can remove it using the command:
	rmdir -p  documents
    Notice: all the subfolders within documents are removed including OldFiles
	
  c)
	absolute dir: /home/freecomp/docs/mycv
	relative dir: ~/docs/mycv

5. cp /etc/passwd ~/mypassword

6. mv mypassword oldpassword

7. cd /usr/bin

   cd /home/gehad
   cd ~
   cd ../../home/gehad 
   cd

8. ls /usr/bin/w* 

9. 'type' command is used to know the command type; for example: shell built-in command (pwd, cd, ..) or  a user space command (mkdir, rm, cp, ..)

10. using the command:
	 type $(ls c*)
    we found that file commnads are: cat, chmod

11. using the command
	man -k file, read, print
    we found that the command is cat

12. apropos command is quite equivalent to "man -k" command; it searches the manual page for a command using a keyword related to the command description.
